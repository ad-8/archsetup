# archsetup
My personal setup script. Work in progress.

## System Requirements
To build `paru`, the system should have 6+ GB of RAM (failed in a VM with 4 GB).

## How To
Before running the scripts, check/update the package lists in the `pkgs` directory.

1. install arch
2. install `git`, clone this repo && cd into it
3. `sudo ./01-setup.sh`
4. `./02-setup.sh`
5. reboot the system
